COVID-19 Data Analysis Project Using SQL

This COVID-19 data analysis project used SQL to extract valuable insights from a large and complex dataset of COVID-19 cases and deaths from the Covid-19 data Available in Google. The project involved the following steps:

Data preparation: The COVID-19 data was downloaded from the JHU CSSE website and loaded into a PostgreSQL database. The data was then cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies.
Data transformation: The data was transformed into a format that was suitable for analysis. This involved tasks such as converting dates and times to a consistent format and combining data from multiple sources.
SQL queries: A variety of SQL queries were written to analyze the COVID-19 data. The queries were used to answer questions about the pandemic, such as:
Which countries have the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths?
What is the trend of COVID-19 cases over time in different countries?
What is the average COVID-19 death rate by country?
Which age groups are most at risk from COVID-19?
Which states in the United States have the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths?
Data visualization: Tableau was used to visualize the results of the analysis. The visualizations were used to communicate key insights, such as the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths, the relationship between age and COVID-19 mortality, and the trend of COVID-19 cases over time in different countries.
The project revealed the following insights:

The United States, India, and Brazil have the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The trend of COVID-19 cases over time is different in different countries. Some countries, such as the United States, have experienced multiple waves of cases, while other countries have been able to control the spread of the virus more effectively.
The average COVID-19 death rate is highest among older adults.
The states of California, Texas, and Florida have the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States.
This project demonstrates the potential of SQL to extract valuable insights from large and complex datasets. The insights gained from this project can be used to inform decision-making about the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health challenges.
